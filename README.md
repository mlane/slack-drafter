# 🧠 slack-reply-assistant

A lightweight, GPT-powered Slack bot that suggests thoughtful, personalized replies whenever you're mentioned in a thread.

> Inspired by the [LLM Engineering Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mlane/llm-engineering-cheatsheet)

- ✨ Automatically triggers when you're mentioned
- 🧵 Understands thread context to avoid repeating what's already been said
- 🧑‍💼 Adapts to your tone (IC vs leader)
- 👀 Review-first: Suggestions are private until you click to send
- ⚡ Built with FastAPI, OpenAI, and Slack Bolt

> Perfect for engineers, PMs, and creators who want to reply faster — without losing their voice.

## ✍️ Personalization

To customize replies to your voice:

1. Add 3–5 example Slack replies you’ve written to `src/reply_suggester/prompt_builder.py`
2. These will be used as few-shot examples when GPT suggests responses
3. (Optional) Add tone logic to vary replies for ICs vs execs

---

## ⚙️ Slack App Setup

1. Create a Slack App at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Enable **Socket Mode** and set up **Event Subscriptions**
3. Add these scopes:
