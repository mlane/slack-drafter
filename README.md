## Minimal Testing

To keep LLM costs low, we recommend basic tests for:

- `extract_slack_ids()`
- `format_timestamp()`
- `format_user()`

Example:

```python
# tests/slack_utils_tests.py
def test_format_timestamp():
    ts = "1714774008.000000"
    formatted = format_timestamp(ts)
    assert formatted == "2024-05-03 10:06 PM UTC"
```
